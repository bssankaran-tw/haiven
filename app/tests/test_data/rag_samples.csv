"What are privacy-enhancing technologies?","Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are designed to offer greater privacy or secrecy for individuals whose data is being processed, stored, and collected by systems and software. These technologies help modify traditional data handling practices, ensuring users' data is not hoarded in raw or plaintext form. PETs facilitate user choice and genuine privacy by providing a better understanding of and better execution of privacy technology.

Key Points:

Definition: PETs are technologies that improve the privacy and secrecy of data processing.
Application: These technologies are used during data processing to handle user data more securely and privately.
Shift to Production: Initially developed in research labs, PETs have transitioned to production systems in recent years.
Broader Impact: While PETs are important, privacy also encompasses personal, social, cultural, and political aspects.
Further Exploration:

Privacy by Design: Incorporating privacy considerations from the outset of the product design.
Privacy and Security Engineering: Deepening knowledge in fields that tackle privacy and security comprehensively.
Remember, privacy technology is a tool among many to address societal inequalities in privacy and power. It should not replace thoughtful approaches to these complex issues.","Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are technologies that provide increased privacy or secrecy for the persons whose data is processed, stored and/or collected by software and systems. Three PETs that are valuable and ready for use are: Differential Privacy, Distributed & Federated Analysis & Learning, and Encrypted Computation. They provide rigorous guarantees for privacy and as such are becoming increasingly popular to provide data in while minimizing violations of private data.","[""Privacy Enhancing Technologies are in the news fairly regularly, with\n    open calls from NIST and the UK\n    government,\n    Singapore and\n    Europe\n    to determine how and where these technologies can and should be used. As a\n    developer, architect or technologist, you might have already heard about or\n    even used these technologies, but your knowledge might be outdated, as\n    research and implementations have shifted significantly in recent years."", ""What are PETs?\nPrivacy Enhancing Technologies (from hereon: PETs) are technologies that\n      provide increased privacy or secrecy for the persons whose data is processed,\n      stored and/or collected by software and systems.
